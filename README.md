# Book Word Analyzer

This project I initiated out of personal interest.

While reading a book in a foreign language, and grappling with its meaning, I was struck by an idea.
Why not extract all the words and create a frequency list, along with a space for translations?
With this list in hand, I could then craft flashcards, prioritizing the most frequent words.

## Please note!

For now the program can only parse the text PDFs.
The version that can parse PDFs that have text in the images is still under development.
